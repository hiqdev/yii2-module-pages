        Provides easy creation of pages for site.

        Supports:

        - different page formats: markdown, twig, PHP
        - extracting front matter

        The idea is to create general mechanism of site pages.
        Pages are taken from and saved to repository.
        And you can provide any compatible repository,
        so pages can be taken from:

        - files (the default repository provided with this package)
        - any database
        - any API
